- 👋 Hi, I’m @akhilrana27
- 👀 I’m interested in data engineering in particular, and software engineering in general. How businesses are built interest me, and I want to get to 
root of businesses using data, and help them grow further.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Scala and Spark in bit more depth, after gaining some exposure to these technologies via a POC project.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the related stuff happening in data engineering.
- 📫 I can be reached via linkedin, my handle is akhilrana27
